# Workshop 4 - Advanced Programming

## Description

This is a simple full-stack application designed for Workshop 4 of the Advanced Programming course. It demonstrates how to connect a front-end with a back-end service and a PostgreSQL database. The application includes a basic HTML interface that interacts with a FastAPI backend to manage product data stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## Libraries Used

### Backend (Python)
- `fastapi`: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- `uvicorn`: A lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using `uvloop` and `httptools`.
- `sqlalchemy`: The Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
- `psycopg2`: A PostgreSQL adapter for Python.

### Frontend (JavaScript)
- Basic JavaScript for making HTTP requests.
